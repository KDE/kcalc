IMPORTANT: On a number of systems including Linux systems using certain 
version of gcc (gcc-2.7.3 RedHat 5.0 for example) will not get a working
version of kcalc unless you undefine the preprosessor symbol FABSL in
../config.h

that is change the line
#define FABSL
to 
/*#define FABLS*/

However this will give you greatly reduced precision. Complain to the
gnu people or to your distribution and pressure them to get a working
version of gcc out.

thanks,

kcalc 0.4
=========

Added statistical functions. Use F3 and F4 to switch between them.
If you have trouble with the mathematical functions used, have a
look at kcalctype.h and make the necessary changes.

kcalc 0.3
=========

kcalc is now mostly complete with regard to basic functionality. A few
rough edges remain. Nevertheless, I believe kcalc will prove a useful
little calculator.

Have fun with kcalc!
