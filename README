kcalc 0.2.1
===========

Please read the Makefile and comment out -DUSE_LONG_DOUBLE if you don't have
long double math on your machine. Linux for example has long double math, 
solaris doesn't seem to have it. If you have it, use -DUSE_LONG_DOUBLE
This will give you higher precision. 


There is still so much to be done.....
Comments and bug-reports are encouraged :-)
