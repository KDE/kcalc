kcalc 0.4
=========

Added statistical functions. Use F3 and F4 to switch between them.
If you have trouble with the mathematical functions used, have a
look at kcalctype.h and make the necessary changes.

kcalc 0.3
=========

kcalc is now mostly complete with regard to basic functionality. A few
rough edges remain. Nevertheless, I believe kcalc will prove a useful
little calculator.

Have fun with kcalc!
