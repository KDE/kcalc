== ToDo ==
* Have a look at Evan's new stack engine kcalc_core.cpp. But be very careful
not to create new bugs. Also think why statistic-function in an independent file.

* Use a *.ui-file for the GUI. This would reduce kcalc.cpp to almost nothing.

* Implement integer arithmetic for (unsigned int, signed int,
unsigned short,...). Look here at some of Evan's code.

* Move constants into an XML-file (right now they are hardcoded in kcalc_const_menu.cpp)

* think what to do with cos, sin, etc. right now, as work-around cast KNumber to double,
use standard libc cos, sin, etc., cast back

====Below old TODOs ===
* get rid of dlabel.h & dlabel.cpp
* key groups for color configuration need to be rethought
* better to handle keys with "accel" or with "keyPressEvent"?

* think about either doing RichText by hand on labels, or only draw visible buttons, to enhance startup time.

* check whether DelFormer Input in stat-mode works after using median!
