<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 What about Precision?</A></H2>

<P>The main factor determining the precision of kcalc is whether your libc libmath
support the C data type <CODE>long double</CODE>. If this is the case, kcalc will detect this
at compile time and use it as it's fundamental data type to represent numbers.</P>

<P>Nevertheless you will be able to observe some "interesting" results when trying
to execute computations such as: 123.22 - 123.21; 2.01 - 2; 123.88 - 123.87 and
similar. If you think this is bad I ask you to do the same computation on 
the windows calculator. You will be in for a good laugh.</P>


<P>The qualitiy of the results of these computations are directly
determined by quality of your libc (printf formatting) and libmath (the math routines). 
There is nothing I can do to improve the precision of kcalc and to get rid of the
strange results such as the above mentioned 2.01 - 2. If you think all you need
to do is to round the 2nd digit past the last visible one -- think again. 
It won't work, at least not on Linux. I have tried everything I could think of
in order to get this to work. I was unable to get it to work and made many horrible discoveries with regard to the quality of libmath
and the printf formatting routines. Nevertheless I would love for you
to prove me wrong and send me a solution that will work ( hopefully across
different platforms )</P>


<P>In future version I will
give the user an options to specify the precision with which kcalc is to
display the results in the display window. This way the user can adjust
things in such a fashion that he will not longer see funny results such as
2.01 - 2 = 0.0999999999999999.</P>
