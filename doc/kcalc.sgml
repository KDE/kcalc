<sect>Introduction<p>
This is release 0.4 of KCalc. KCalc is a simple but hopefully useful scientific
calculator for the KDE project. 

KCalc offers many more mathematical functions than meet the eye on a first glance.
Please study the section on keyboard accelerators and  modes in this handbook to 
learn more about the many functions available.


In addition to the usual functionality offered by most scientific calculators,
KCalc offers a number of features, which I think are worthwhile pointing out:
<p>
<itemize>
<item>KCalc has a trigonometric and a statistics mode.
<item>KCalc allows you to cut and paste numbers
from/into it's display.
<item>KCalc features a 'results-stack' which let's
you conveniently recall previous results. 
<item>You can
configure KCalc's display colors and font.
<item>You can configure KCalc's  precision and the number
of digits after the period.
<item> KCalc offers a great number of useful key-bindings, which make using KCalc
without using a pointing device easy.
</itemize>

Have fun with KCalc!

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KCalc
<p>
KCalc is part  of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KCalc can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site
of the KDE project. It's home site is
<htmlurl url="http://math.cornell.edu/~wuebben/kde.html" name="http://math.cornell.edu/~wuebben/kde.html">

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KCalc, you need the latest versions of <tt> libkdecore</tt> and <tt> libkdeui</tt>. All required libraries as well as KCalc itself can be found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

The usual:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>


Should you run into problems please report them to me.
<p>

<sect> Usage <p>
General usage is straight forward and similar if not identical to the way
most simple scientific calculators operate. Click on the <bf>KCalc</bf>
button to bring up the configuration dialog.
<p>

<sect1> Result Stack
<p>
Each time you click the enter button or press the 'equal' or 'Enter' or 'Return'
keys, the display result is written to KCalc's result stack. You can navigate 
through the result stack by pressing the up and down arrow keys.
<p>

<sect1>
Percent Function<p>
The percent function works somewhat different from that of most calculators.
However, once understood, its enhance functionality proves quite useful.
See the section on the percent function in the "Comments on specific 
functions" section for a details explanation of the percent functionality.
<p>
<sect1>Fixed Precision<p>
Click the fixed precision check-box on the configure dialog if you whish
to fix the number of digits which are displayed past the period.
<p>

<sect1>Cut and Paste
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Pressing the left mouse button on KCalc's display will place the displayed
number on to the clip-board.
<item>Pressing the right or middle mouse button on KCalc's display will paste
the clip-board content into the display if the content of the clip-board
is a valid floating point number.
</itemize>
<p>

<sect>Modes<p>

<sect1>Statistical Mode<p>
Press F4 or bring up the configuration dialog by pushing the KCALC button or
by pressing F2 to switch into statistics mode.

</descrip>

<sect1>Trigonometric Mode<p>
Press F3 or bring up the configuration dialog by pushing the KCALC button or
by pressing F2 to switch into trigonometric mode.

<descrip>
<tag/Hyp/ Enter Hyperbolic sub mode. HYP SIN for example is the hyperbolic sine: sinh(x)

<tag/Sin/ Compute the sine.

<tag/INV Sin/ Compute the inverse sine.

<tag/Cos/ Compute the cosine.

<tag/INV Cos/ Compute the inverse cosine.

<tag/Tan/ Compute the tangents.

<tag/INV Tan/ Compute the inverse tangent.

<tag/Log/ Compute the Log base 10

<tag/INV Log/ Compute the 10 to the power of x

<tag/Ln/ Compute the natural logarithm. That is the log with base e.

<tag/INV Ln/ Compute the natural logarithm. That is the log with base e.

</descrip>

<sect>Comments on specific functions<p>

<sect1>Mod<p>
Give the remainder of dividing the display number by the next input number.
<sect1>%<p>

Interpret the final operation carried out in  the current 
calculation as follows:

<itemize>

The function of the % key is similar to the one found on some CASIO calculators:

<item>If the final operator is + give the percentage increase
the result is over the second operand.

<item> If the final operator is - give the percentage decrease the result 
is over the second operand.

<item>If the final operator is * give the right operand 
as a percentage of the left operand.

<item>If the final operator is / or Mod, give the left operand
as a percentage of the right operand.

<item>If the final operator is x**y give the left operand 
raised to the power of the (right operand / 100).

<item> In all other cases the % key gives identical results to the = key.

</itemize>                              
<sect2>Examples<p>
<verb>

Type:             45 / 55 %
Answer Displayed: 81.8181...
Explanation:      45 is 81.81...percent of 55

Type:             11 + 89 %
Answer Displayed: 112.35.. 
Explanation:      89 + 11 = 100 and  100 is 112.35 percent of 89. 
</verb>
<p>
<sect1>Lsh (Rsh)<p>
Left (right) shift the n times, where n is the next input number.
You get Rsh (right shift)  by pressing INV Lsh.

<p>

<sect>Questions and Answers<p>
<sect1>How do I get pi=3.1415926...?<p>
Simply type INV EE.
<p>
<sect1>How do I get e, the Euler number?<p>
Type 1 INV ln.
<p>


<sect1>How do I get two fixed digits after the period?<p>
Click on the KCalc button, this will bring up the configuration dialog.
Click on "Set Fixed Precision" and adjust the spin control so that it
shows a 2.<p>

<sect1>What about Precision?<p>
The main factor determining the precision of kcalc is whether your libc and libmath
supports the C data type <tt>long double</tt>. If this is the case, kcalc will detect this
at compile time and use it as it's fundamental data type to represent numbers.
Check KCalc's about dialog in order to find out what the fundamental data type
for your copy of KCalc is.
<p>

Unless you have a libc and libmath of exceptionally high quality, you will
be able to observe some "interesting" results when trying
to execute computations such as: 123.22 - 123.21; 2.01 - 2; 123.88 - 123.87 and
similar. However if you think this is bad I ask you to do the same computation on 
the windows calculator.
<p>
Adjust the precision on KCalc's configure dialog so that the above computation
go through correctly. I recommend a precision of 14 if the fundamental data
type for your copy of KCalc is long double, otherwise 8 or 10.
<p>
Note: Higher precision doesn't necessarily lead to better results. Play with
the precision and you will see what I mean.
