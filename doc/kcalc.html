<P><BR>
This is release 2.1 of kcalc. Although I think that this  version is
 already quite useful, some important functionality is yet to be 
implemented -- most notably EE mode. 
Apart from some of the KeyAccels, usage is completely straightforward. </P>

<H2>Installation:</H2>

<P>Read the Makefile and comment out -DUSE_LONG_DOUBLE  if you don't have
long double math on your machine. Linux does have long double math, whereas
solaris doesn't seem to have it. If you have long double math functions, 
use -DUSE_LONG_DOUBLE .This will give you better precision. I tested this
calculator on Linux as well as Sun Solaris.

<H2>KeyAccels:</H2>
<P>The Key-Accels were chosen in such a fashion as to allow you to conveniently
operate the calculator without moving you hands from their standard keyboard
position.

<PRE>ALT + X    exit the calculator 
ALT + q    exit the calculator 
ALT + x    exit the calculator 
ALT + d    set trig-mode to deg
ALT + r    set trig-mode to rad
ALT + g    set trig-mode to grad
ALT + e    set radix to decimal
ALT + o    set radix to octal
ALT + b    set radix to binary
s          Sin 
o          Cos 
t          Tan
i          Inv inverse, e.g. if you want arcsin(x) type i s 
\          +/- 
[          ^2 
^          x^y 
=          = 
r          1/x r for reciproc 
Enter      = 
Return     = 
Backspace  CA 
Del        CA
